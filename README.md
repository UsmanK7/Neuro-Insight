## üöÄ **Project Overview**
Brain tumor detection and diagnosis can be a time-consuming and error-prone process when relying on manual methods. **NeuroInsight** aims to address these challenges by integrating AI to:
- **Detect the presence of brain tumors** in MRI scans.
- **Segment tumor regions** into key sub-regions: edema, enhancing tumor, and non-enhancing tumor.
- **Classify tumor types** into **glioblastoma** or **lower-grade glioma**.

By automating these tasks, **NeuroInsight** significantly reduces human error and the time required for diagnosis, empowering healthcare professionals with a more reliable tool for accurate decision-making.

## üõ†Ô∏è **How It Works**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The MRI scans are preprocessed to ensure consistency, normalization, and preparation for model training.
2. **Tumor Detection**: AI models are trained to predict the presence of tumors in the provided MRI scans.
3. **Tumor Segmentation**: The model performs pixel-level segmentation to classify tumor sub-regions (edema, enhancing, non-enhancing tumor).
4. **Tumor Classification**: Using the segmented data, the model classifies tumor types, distinguishing between glioblastoma and lower-grade gliomas.
5. **Web Application**: A user-friendly web app that allows healthcare professionals to upload MRI scans and receive automated reports, with interactive visualizations of tumor regions.
